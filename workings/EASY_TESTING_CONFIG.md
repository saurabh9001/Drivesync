# ðŸ§ª Easy Testing Configuration - SOS Emergency System

## **Updated G-Force Thresholds (EXTREMELY LOW for Testing)**

### **Accident Detection System:**
- **3.0G** = Basic accident detection (shows notification)
- **2.0G** = **SEVERE ACCIDENT** â†’ **TRIGGERS EMERGENCY SOS** ðŸš¨

### **Road Condition System (Separate):**
- **1.2G** = Smooth road

## **Expected Behavior at 2G+:**

```
1. Accelerometer detects 2G+ G-force
2. MultiSensorAccidentDetector calculates accident score
3. Score â‰¥ 6.0 â†’ AccidentSeverity.severe
4. MainAppProvider._handleSevereAccident() called
5. EmergencySOSService.triggerEmergencySOS() executed
6. SMS sent: "ACCIDENT DETECTED! G-force impact detected..."
7. Emergency call made to 9325709787
8. Red notification shown to user
```

## **Testing Verification:**

### **Console Logs to Watch:**
```
ðŸš¨ SEVERE ACCIDENT DETECTED - EMERGENCY PROCEDURES ACTIVATED
ðŸ“± Sending emergency SMS with location...
ðŸ“ž Calling Emergency Services...
âœ… Emergency SOS triggered successfully
```

### **Phone Should:**
- Show red emergency notification
- Send SMS to 9325709787 with GPS location
- Attempt to call 9325709787 automatically
- Display "Emergency alert sent successfully!" message

## **Production Settings:**
Remember to change back to realistic thresholds for production:
- `ACCIDENT_G_THRESHOLD = 10.0` (real accidents)
- `SEVERE_G_THRESHOLD = 15.0` (severe accidents)
